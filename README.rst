About
-----

Dstat is a versatile replacement for vmstat, iostat, mpstat, netstat and
ifstat. Dstat overcomes some of their limitations and adds some extra
features, more counters and flexibility. Dstat is handy for monitoring
systems during performance tuning tests, benchmarks or troubleshooting.

This is a fork of dstat's plugins intended to maintain full compatibility
version 1.7 of dstat, and any future released versions.
